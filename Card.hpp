// Represent a Card's Rank.
// Rank is a type that can represent the specific values
// listed in the definition below, but no others. (In memory
// the Rank values are represented as integers from 0 to 12.)
// Use the values as constants, for example:
//   Rank r1 = FOUR;
//   Rank r2 = NINE;
// Ranks may be compared (this compares the underlying int values):
//   if (r1 < r2) { // this condition is true
// Overloaded << and >> operators are also defined farther below to
// enable stream input/output for Rank objects:
//   cout << r1 << endl; // prints "Four"
//   cin >> r2 << endl;  // reads a string from cin and updates r2
// Because the underlying representation of the enum is an integer,
// objects of type Rank are ok to pass/return by value.
